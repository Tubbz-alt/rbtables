# rbtables

_rbtables_ is a fast, parallel implementation of [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) in Rust. It is intended as an API, supporting general use cases of rainbow tables. The user will need to supply hashing and reduction functions. Chains can be outputted and stored using JSON.
